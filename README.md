In the command line type - git add .

git commit -m "This is being committed" git push

  

To add all new files or modified file use " ." - To add a single file use the pathway to the file eg .index.html or assets/css/style.css When committing make sure your comments are clear about what changes have been made. Pushing will send your work to the repository

- Clicked the "Settings" button in the menu above the Repository.

- Scroll down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.

- Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and then select "Master Branch".

- The page will automatically refresh, and a link displaced. It may take some time for the link to show the website.

### Forking

  

Forking the GitHub Repository

  

By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account. This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

  

- Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.

- At the top of the Repository there is a "Fork" button about the "Settings" button on the menu.

- You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

  

### Cloning

  

Making a Local Clone

  

- Log into your GitHub then find the gitpod repository

- Under the repository name there is a button that says "Clone or download". Click on this button.

- If cloning with HTTPS "Clone with HTTPS", copy this link.

- Open Gitbash

- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be.

- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

```

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

Press - Enter- Your local clone will be created.
